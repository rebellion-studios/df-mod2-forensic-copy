The clock is striking 13
It's time to scream for your team
We don't have to say goodbye
'Cause friends like these will never die
'Cause tonight we're gonna leave our fears behind
We're in it together
Stepping out and we're letting our spirits fly
Stay fierce forever
Freak out if you dare
Your best nightmare
Don't stop rocking your right to fright
We are Monster High
